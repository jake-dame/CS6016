**To determine what keys are think in terms of:**

1. Is it unique? (no duplicates in column). If yes? --> Superkey
2. Is it minimal? (none of it's broken up guys are *already* unique). If yes? --> key and ALSO superkey

If all you remember is this, let it be:

    `SUPERKEYS ARE UNIQUE`
    `KEYS      ARE UNIQUE and MINIMAL`


{x}
{xy} 
{xyz}
{xyza}
